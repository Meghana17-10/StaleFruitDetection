# StaleFruitDetection
Stale Fruit Detection | AI-powered system using Swin Transformer &amp; CNNs to classify fruits as fresh or stale in cold storage. Helps reduce food waste, improve inventory management, and streamline monitoring. Built with PyTorch, FastAPI, and MongoDB

# Stale Fruit Detection â€“ Personal Work

This is my some of personal contribution space for a collaborative project titled **"Stale Fruit Detection using AI"**, developed as part of our coursework at Keshav Memorial College of Engineering.

ðŸ‘‰ Full team repository: [Stale Fruit Detection â€“ Team Repo](https://github.com/jithender2005/Stale-Fruit-Detection)

## My Contributions:
- Built and trained image classification models using:
  - CNN (baseline)
  - Vision Transformer (ViT)
  - Swin Transformer (final model)
- Assisted in polishing the frontend UI (design tweaks, responsiveness, image upload flow)
- Integrated backend with MongoDB for storing user data and prediction history
- Helped in testing user authentication (initial version worked, removed due to last-minute bugs)
- Participated in overall testing, debugging, and UIâ€“backend integration
